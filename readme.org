#+TITLE: Arrow streams

Monoidal streams are a coinductive construction that generalizes streams to
arbitrary monoidal categories. Monoidal streams form a feedback monoidal
category that allows us to interpret signal flow graphs and give semantics to
dataflow programming.

This repository implements premonoidal streams over Haskell =Arrows= (Set-based
Freyd categories). Premonoidal streams are Arrows themselves.
